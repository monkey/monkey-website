<h2>Monkey HTTP Daemon v0.10.1 has been released</h2>
<p>
Monkey HTTP Daemon is a very Fast and Lightweight Web Server for Linux. It has been designed to be very scalable with low memory and CPU consumption, the perfect solution for embedded and high production environments.  
</p>
<p>
The project was started in 2001, internally it used to work with forking and threading networking models to attend clients, now, our current release 0.10.0 is one of our major milestone, we have a new web server working in asyncronous mode, fixed threads and with an excellent performance.

<h2>What is new ?</h2>
