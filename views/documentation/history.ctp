>&#13;   Everyone has his own story, let's talk about Monkey story. In 
   Chile-SouthAmerica, since 2000, every year takes place a Linux Conference 
   (Encuentro Linux) which is an open event where anyone can participate as a speaker,
   assistant or sponsor.
 </P
><P
>&#13;   In the second version of the event in October 2001, a Monkey took a bus and travel 
   eight hours to get to the Concepcion city to attend the event. There were too many
   interesting talks and one of them was about embedded devices, and the company
   speaker that gave the talk, talk about that they were developing a web server in C
   for embedded devices and everyone interested could participate. 
 </P
><P
>&#13;   After the talk, the 
   Monkey who was very excited, talked to one of the company developers team about that 
   he was interested into contribute, the developer asked
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"do you know C ?"</SPAN
> and the Monkey answered <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"No, but i can learn"</SPAN
> 
   and the developer replied back <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"sorry, you can not participate"</SPAN
>. On that
   moment the Monkey felt frustrated asking himself 
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"why this guy told me that i can not learn ?"</SPAN
>. When the event ended and 
   the Monkey get back home, decided to probe to his self that he can write his own 
   web server and will learn C and HTTP, on that specific moment 
   <SPAN

> was born.
 </P
><P
>&#13;   Later in 2001, the first version of <SPAN
CLASS="productname"
>Monkey HTTP Daemon</SPAN
> was 
   released under the terms of the GPLv2 License. One year later in 2002 the project 
   is presented in the third version of the Linux Conference.
