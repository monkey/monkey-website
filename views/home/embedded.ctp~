<h1>Monkey for Embedded Devices</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Monkey is a Fast and Lightweight Web Server for Linux, for embedded devices is the best option available
due to it's flexibility and well designed architecture.
</p>
<p>
Most of web servers lack of flexibility for embedded devices, they offer too much functionalities 
which are not required in all cases spending resources where is not necessary. Functionalities are good
when they are used, but in other cases they are just sacrificing performance and scalability.
</p>

<p>
Monkey HTTP Daemon offers a flexible architecture where the core implements the HTTP/1.1 protocol and 
a plugin interface to extend the core functionalities through the application programming interface (API).
</p>

The plugin API, allows you to implement your own hooks and create specific behaviors depending of the events 
along the web server working cycle, inclusive you can also define your own networking socket interfaces and 
add some encryption layer if required.
