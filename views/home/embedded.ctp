<p>
Monkey is a Fast and Lightweight HTTP Server for GNU/Linux, for embedded devices is the best option available
due to it's flexibility and well designed architecture. It has an excellent performance in architectures such
as ARM or x86 as well.

Most of HTTP servers lack of flexibility for embedded devices, they offer too much functionalities
which are not required in all cases spending resources where is not necessary. Functionalities are good
when they are used, but in other cases they are just sacrificing performance and scalability.

a C plugin interface to extend the core functionalities through the application programming interface (API).

along the HTTP server working cycle, inclusive you can also define your own networking socket interfaces and
add some encryption layer if required.
